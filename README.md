This repository contains code from my Algorithm classes at Binghamton University.

The code is written in C and algorithms/problems are:
- Cleared Checks
- Dijkstra - Shortest Path (Priority queue approach
- Ferry Loading (Knapsack problem)
- Fibonacci (Dynamic Programming approach)
- Fibonacci (Recursive Approach)
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Kruskal - Minimum Spanning Tree (Matrix approach)
- Optimal Binary Search Tree
- QuickSort (Hoare partition and pivot randomization)
